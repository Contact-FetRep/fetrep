    <h3>FetRep Chrome Extension</h3>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>
        FetRep is a reputation extension for FetLife.com allowing Fetlife members to vote up or down a reputation
        score for other members. It is intended to provide the kink community a point of reference about a person's
        overall trustworthiness and to spur discussion about a user's reputation within the overall kink scene.
        It is the expressed hope of FetRep that this will lead to better awareness of problems within the scene.
    </p>
    <h4>Usage</h4>
    <p>
        Fetrep allows simple up/down voting when on a user's profile page and displays basic statistics about the votes
        cast by the community concerning the member in question.
    </p>

            <h5>It allows:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Users to cast a single vote, up or down, for other users.</li>
                <li>Users to change their vote once per 30 day period.</li>
                <li>Users to not vote. Usage of the FetRep extension is entirely voluntary.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>It does not allow:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Users to vote on themselves.</li>
                <li>Users to see who has voted for who.</li>
                <li>Justification for the reason why people voted.</li>
                <li>An explanation for why someone may be receiving upvotes or downvotes.</li>
            </ul>

    <p>
        Please consider the reasons for voting very carefully. This is a social browser extension that only really works
        if people use it for the right reasons.
    </p>

            <h5 class="">Some reasons why <u>it might not</u> be valid to downvote someone:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>You don't like their pictures: Not everyone is a professional photographer.</li>
                <li>You don't like their fetishes: It is okay to have preferences (immoral and illegal
                    fetishes are not a preference! If you have to ask if something is immoral or illegal, it
                    probably is...).
                </li>
                <li>You don't like their writings: Not everyone has the benefit of a high education,
                    or the same viewpoint as you do.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="">Some reasons why <u>it might</u> be valid to downvote someone:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>They have no remorse for consent violations they've committed.</li>
                <li>They discriminate, commit hate speech, or have general disregard for other people and things.</li>
                <li>They use their celebrity status to exploit people.</li>
                <li>They abuse other people/animals.</li>
            </ul>

    <h5 class="remark">If the extension ends up causing harm to the scene, it can be disabled at any time.</h5>
    <p>Consider this to be a tool for good. The developer reserves the right to shut the project down at their own
        discretion.
