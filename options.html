    <h3>FetRep Chrome Extension</h3>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>
        FetRep is a reputation extension for FetLife.com allowing Fetlife members to vote up or down a reputation
        score for other members. It is intended to provide the kink community a point of reference about a person's
        overall trustworthiness and to spur discussion about a user's reputation within the overall kink scene.
        It is the expressed hope of FetRep that this will lead to better awareness of problems within the scene.
    </p>
    <h4>Usage</h4>
    <p>
        Fetrep allows simple up/down voting when on a user's profile page and displays basic statistics about the votes
        cast by the community concerning the member in question. It allows you to vote once for any Fetlife member and
        allows you to change your vote for a member once per month (30 days).
    </p>
    <h4>Privacy</h4>
    <p>
        FetRep does not collect any user data other than that explicitly required to track reputation (score). We do
        not collect or store your login information, any personal or identifiable data from your browser session, or
        any information you enter into FetLife.com. FetRep also does not monetize or sell reputation data in any way.
