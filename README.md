FetRep Chrome Extension

FetRep is a reputation extension for FetLife.com allowing Fetlife members to vote up or down a reputation score for other members. It is intended to provide the kink community a point of reference about a person's overall trustworthiness and to spur discussion about a user's reputation within the overall kink scene. It is the expressed hope of FetRep that this will lead to better awareness of problems within the scene.

Usage
Fetrep allows simple up/down voting when on a user's profile page and displays basic statistics about the votes cast by the community concerning the member in question.

It allows:
* Users to cast a single vote, up or down, for other users.
* Users to change their vote once per 30 day period.
* Users to not vote. Usage of the FetRep extension is entirely voluntary.

It does not allow:
* Users to vote on themselves.
* Users to see who has voted for who.
* Justification for the reason why people voted.
* An explanation for why someone may be receiving upvotes or downvotes.
Please consider the reasons for voting very carefully. This is a social browser extension that only really works if people use it for the right reasons.

Some reasons why it might not be valid to downvote someone:
*You don't like their pictures: Not everyone is a professional photographer.
*You don't like their fetishes: It is okay to have preferences (immoral and illegal fetishes are not a preference! If you have to ask if something is immoral or illegal, it probably is...).
*You don't like their writings: Not everyone has the benefit of a high education, or the same viewpoint as you do.

Some reasons why it might be valid to downvote someone:
* They have no remorse for consent violations they've committed.
* They discriminate, commit hate speech, or have general disregard for other people and things.
* They use their celebrity status to exploit people.
* They abuse other people/animals.

If the extension ends up causing harm to the scene, it can be disabled at any time.

Consider this to be a tool for good. The developer reserves the right to shut the project down at their own discretion.
